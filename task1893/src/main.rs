/*
You are given a 2D integer array ranges and two integers left and right.
Each ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents an inclusive interval between start_i and end_i.
Return true if each integer in the inclusive range [left, right] is covered by at least one
interval in ranges. Return false otherwise.
An integer x is covered by an interval ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i] if start_i <= x <= end_i.

Example 1:
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.

Example 2:
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
